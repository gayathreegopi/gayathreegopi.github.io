# Welcome! I'm Gayathree Gopi

I'm a strategy-focused analytics professional currently pursuing my Master of Science in Business Analytics at UT Austin’s McCombs School of Business. I specialize in transforming complex data into clear, actionable insights that support investment decisions, market strategy, and operational clarity.

With a foundation in computational biology and hands-on experience across real estate analytics, financial forecasting, and market research, my recent work includes building geospatial dashboards, investor targeting tools, and multi-criteria models for evaluating site-level or portfolio-level investment opportunities.

## [What I Do Best](/about/)

I help organizations make faster, smarter, and more strategic decisions by combining:

- **Analytics & Modeling** – Python, SQL, Tableau, Power BI  
- **Real Estate & Investment Strategy** – Forecasting, investor modeling, competitive benchmarking  
- **Structured Thinking** – Navigating ambiguity, communicating with clarity  
- **Geospatial & Market Insight Tools** – Mapping, prioritization, site selection frameworks

I also bring creativity into my problem-solving — shaped by a lifelong interest in art, visual design, and narrative structure. Whether it's a model, a dashboard, or a slide deck, I approach every project with a balance of rigor and intuition.
