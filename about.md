# About Me

I'm a strategy-minded analytics professional currently pursuing my MS in Business Analytics at UT Austin. With a foundation in computational biology and growing experience in real estate investment and data consulting, I focus on transforming complex data into insights that support business decisions, market strategy, and investment outcomes.

My recent work spans multifamily real estate analytics, investment forecasting, and structured market research. I’ve supported a $20M pipeline for an urban redevelopment firm, automated investment analysis processes for multifamily comps, and built sentiment-augmented forecasting models for cryptocurrency price movement.

Whether it’s developing a weighted scoring model for market prioritization or presenting site selection recommendations using geospatial data, I approach problems by blending clarity, curiosity, and structured thinking.

## My Technical Toolkit

I work across business analytics, data science, and visualization tools to bring structure to ambiguity:

**Languages & Tools:**  
- **Python:** pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, spaCy, matplotlib, TensorFlow  
- **SQL, R**, Excel (advanced), Tableau, Neo4j, Git  
- **Optimization:** gurobipy, scipy  
- **Certifications:** Google Data Analytics, Google BI, Snowflake  

**Application Areas:**  
- Investment modeling & forecasting  
- Real estate analytics  
- Sentiment analysis & NLP  
- Market research & automation

## Outside the Spreadsheet

Beyond analytics, I have a lifelong creative streak — I run a devotional art brand (Chitralekha Creations), design visual narratives, and experiment with storytelling through both code and color. I believe insight is strongest when it’s both rigorous and relatable.
